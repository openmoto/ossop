# IRIS - Incident Response Made Easy

## What is IRIS?

IRIS (Incident Response Investigation System) is like a digital case file for security incidents. It helps you organize investigations, track evidence, manage tasks, and work with your team to solve security problems. Think of it as a detective's notebook that multiple people can use at the same time.

**Access:** http://localhost:8080
