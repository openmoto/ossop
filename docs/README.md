## üîÑ How Tools Work Together

### Investigation Workflow
1. **OpenSearch Dashboards** detects suspicious activity
2. **IRIS** creates an incident case for investigation
3. **SpiderFoot** gathers intelligence about the threat
4. **MISP** stores and shares threat indicators found
5. **Shuffle** automates response actions
6. **DefectDojo** tracks any vulnerabilities discovered
7. **Eramba** updates risk assessments based on findings

### Daily Security Operations
1. **Morning:** Check OpenSearch Dashboards for overnight alerts
2. **Investigate:** Use IRIS to manage any security incidents
3. **Research:** Use SpiderFoot to gather threat intelligence
4. **Share:** Add findings to MISP for community benefit
5. **Automate:** Use Shuffle to speed up common tasks
6. **Fix:** Track vulnerability remediation in DefectDojo
7. **Report:** Use Eramba for management updates
